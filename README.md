# missionbit-libgdx-examples

Here's some example code for LibGDX, we'll add before the end of the summer.
Each different example is in it's own Drawable class.  In order to switch between examples, open the LibGDXExamples class and comment / uncomment the Drawable that's used in create().

```java
        // Collision demo
        drawable = new SimpleCollisionDrawable(camera);

        // Text drawing demo
        //drawable = new TextUIDrawable(camera);
```
